# calculator

A basic web-based non-scientific calculator. Purpose of this project is to enhance my JavaScript foundational skill.

At the moment, it only supports basic arithmetic operations like plus, subtract, multiply and divide. Takes only 2 operands at a time.

Display screen is limited to display digits up to 12 digits, and 11 if decimal is present.

Keyboard support is available. 

For AC (All Clear) button, just click 'C' key or 'Delete' key.
